# My React Vite Template

## This is a React Vite Template

## How to clone

```sh
npx tiged ScottFeichter/my-react-vite-template#main <new-project-name>
```

This clones of repo main branch under the name in the directory where it is run.

## How to install and run

Be sure to be in correct folder and run `npm install` and `npm run dev`.

```sh
cd my-react-vite-template
npm install
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` runs the `dev` script from your __package.json__; you will run
this command whenever you want to start your app.

When it runs, you should see something like this in the terminal:

```bash
VITE v4.5.0  ready in 592 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://127.0.0.1:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h to show help
```
Might also read as `Local: http://localhost:5173/`

## Open a browser

Open a browser to [http://localhost:5173].

(Or type `o` in the terminal where Vite is running)

You should see `Hello from App`

## Change or convert files

__index.html__ change `title` \
__package.json__ change `"name"` \
__README.md__ customize to the project \
